# Simple E-Commerce

A basic e-commerce application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Display a list of products with prices
- Add products to a shopping cart
- View and remove items from the shopping cart
- Checkout functionality (simulated)

## How it works

1. The application loads a list of products from a JavaScript array.
2. Each product is displayed with a "Add to cart" button.
3. When a product is added to the cart, it is stored in local storage.
4. The cart is updated in real-time to reflect the added or removed items.
5. The checkout button simulates a successful checkout by clearing the cart.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the application logic.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the application.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Local Storage API
